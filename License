### What to do next (fast path)

1) Open your repo → **README.md** → paste the entire block above → **Commit**.  
2) Upload your CSV to `/data`.  
3) Run the code blocks in R (they’re standalone).  
4) Later, move each block into `/scripts/01_fixed_effects.R`, `/scripts/02_did_models.R`, `/scripts/03_gmm_dynamic.R`.

If you want, I can also generate **small synthetic test data** so everything runs even before you finalize your real CSV.
